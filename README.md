# Hangman - Project Documentation Guideline

> (Include here a brief description of the project, what technologies are used etc.)
> 
> Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 1: Set up the enviroment

- Setting up of the dev enviroment. Covering the following prerequisites:
  1. Setting up
  2. Operating Systems
  3. What is the command line
  4. File Navigation & File Paths
  5. File Manipulation
- Setting up of GitHub
  
- (Answer some of these questions in the next few bullet points. What have you built? What technologies have you used? Why have you used those?)
- (Example: The FastAPI framework allows for fast and easy construction of APIs and is combined with pydantic, which is used to assert the data types of all incoming data to allow for easier processing later on. The server is ran locally using uvicorn, a library for ASGI server implementation.)
  
```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert an image/screenshot of what you have built so far here.

## Milestone 2: Create the variables fo the game

- Using Python commands such as if-else statments and while loops. Covering the following prerequisites:
  1. What is Python?
  2. Google Colab
  3. Variables
  4. Comments
  5. Numbers
  6. Strings
  7. Booleans
  8. Lists
- Task 1: Defining a list of posisble words. Creating a file named milestone_2.py. This file contains the code for the first milestone. In this task, we are creating a list of words.
- Further prerequisites:
  1. Package managers
  2. pip
  3. conda
  4. Dictionaries
  5. Tuples
  6. Sets
  7. Intro to Control Flow
  8. Imports
- Task 3: Asking the user for input.
- Task 4: Checking that the input is a single character. Validating the input to ensure only a single letter is entered and that only alphabetical characters are provided by the user.
- Followed by prerequisite:
  1. Github README files
- Task 5: Started documenting experience. Uploaded files to the repository and created a README file. Added documentation to README file. Described the code written in this milestone.
- Task 6: Updated the lastest code changes to GitHub. Upload the latest code changes from your local project repository to GitHub. To do so, first add your changes to the staging area and make a commit. Finally, push the changes to GitHub.


- (Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).)

- (Example below:)

```bash
/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
```

- (The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:)

```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

> 
> "C:\Users\chemi\hangman_project\MS2 screen shot of GitHub repo.jpg"

## Milestone 3: Check if the guessed character is in the word

- Prerequisite:
  1. For Loops, Iteration and Control Flow Tricks
- Task 1: Iteratively checking if the input is a valid guess. Coding it so that it continuously ask the user for a letter and validates it. Creating a new script called milestone_3.py. 

## Milestone n

- (Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.)

- (Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!)

## Conclusions

- (Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.)

- (Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive?)
